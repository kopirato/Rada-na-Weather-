# Selian Weather App - Static Frontend

This is a static weather app built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
It uses OpenWeather's **Current Weather Data** API. The app is ready to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## How to use
1. Get a free API key from OpenWeather: https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Open `script.js` and replace the placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY` with your key.
3. Upload the repository content to GitHub and enable Pages (branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`).
4. Visit `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/selian-weather-app` after Pages is enabled.

## Files
- index.html — main page
- styles.css — styling
- script.js — fetches weather and updates UI
- assets/* — icons and illustrations

Made for Selian. Enjoy!
